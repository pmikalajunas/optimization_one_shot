        "* This notebook is for exploring architectural specifications for neurally diverse architectures on a small and imbalanced version of MNIST.\n",
        "* The architecture includes pre-branch, branch, and post-branch segments. Neural diversity is implemented specifically at the level of activation function non-linearity and a small wet of \"connection functions\" (i.e. linear, identity, and element-wise scaling).\n",

        "* 0.3.7 - added id and elementwise scaling weight functions.\n",
        "* 0.3.8 - added training acuracies; do_train is now returning the model with the best validation error.\n",
